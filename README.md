8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission
•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. Application to create two clocks that display simultaneously 
•	What did you do particularly well? I feel I was able to structure the code in a clear and concise arrangement. 
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? I feel I could’ve been better with the pseudocode and flow chart. I felt bother were a little messy/ hard to read and could’ve been structured better 
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? This project will help me prepare to design and structure codes much more complex in the future
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I made this readable by putting it into Notepad first so that I was able to read the code better and highlight areas that needed work
